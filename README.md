# ALX-T and Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project Submission


Introduction to Data Analysis project.

I chose the TMDB dataset option where I analyzed over 10,000 rows of movie data from 1960-2015 to answer the following questions:

- The average movie runtime trend 
- The most popular genres over the years 
- The most popular production companies over the years 
- The factors that most likely influence the revenue generated
