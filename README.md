# ALX-T and Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Projects
Projects I completed during the program.

- [Introduction to Data Analysis - Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/ssarrayya/alx-udacity_projects/tree/main/TMDb_movie_data)  
I chose the TMDb movie dataset option where I analyzed over 10,000 rows of movie data from 1960-2015 to answer the following questions:
    - The average movie runtime trend 
    - The most popular genres over the years 
    - The most popular production companies over the years 
    - The factors that most likely influence the revenue generated 


- [Wrangle and Analyze Data - WeRateDogs Twitter Analysis](https://github.com/ssarrayya/alx-udacity_projects/tree/main/WeRateDogs_analysis)
I wrangled datasets gathered from 3 different sources and in 3 different file formats to produce high-quality and tidy datasets. Afterwards, I analyzed the data in order to explore the:
    - Top 5 most popular dog names
    - Top 5 breeds in the first predictions by the neural network
    - Relationship between the ratings and favourite count
    - Relationship between the number of images and retweet count

- [Data Visualization]()
